# ðŸŽ¯ Simple NFT Contract Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ **One-Time Setup for Your NFT Collection**

Each NFT collection needs its own smart contract deployed **once**. After deployment, your PFP generator will mint NFTs directly to your contract.

## ðŸ“‹ **What You Need**

- âœ… MetaMask wallet with ETH for gas fees (~$50-200)
- âœ… Your collection details (name, symbol, pricing)
- âœ… 10 minutes of your time

## ðŸŽ¯ **Two Easy Options**

### **Option 1: Super Easy (Recommended)**
Use your admin panel â†’ Click "Show Step-by-Step Guide" â†’ Follow the visual instructions

### **Option 2: Quick Deploy**
Use your admin panel â†’ Fill form â†’ Click "Deploy Contract Now"

## ðŸ”¥ **After Deployment**

1. **Copy your contract address** (starts with 0x...)
2. **Update your PFP generator** with the new address
3. **Start minting NFTs!** ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ’¡ **Important Notes**

- âœ… **One-time only** - you never need to deploy again
- âœ… **Your contract** - you own it completely
- âœ… **Your royalties** - you get all the profits
- âœ… **Your collection** - appears on OpenSea under your name

## ðŸŽ¨ **What Happens Next**

After deployment:
1. Users visit your PFP generator

4. You earn from every mint + ongoing royalties
5. NFTs appear on OpenSea automatically
