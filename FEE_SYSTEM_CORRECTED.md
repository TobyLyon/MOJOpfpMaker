# 🔧 CORRECTED Fee System - MOJO NFT

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Fee Calculation Corrected**
**Problem:** Contract was getting full payment + platform was getting extra fee
**Solution:** Platform gets 5% of user payment, contract gets remaining 95%

### **2. Royalty Management Added**
**Problem:** Royalties were fixed at deployment
**Solution:** Admin can now adjust royalties through admin panel

---

## 💰 **How the Corrected Fee System Works**

### **User Experience (Unchanged):**
- User sees: "Mint for 0.001 ETH"
- User pays: 0.001 ETH total
- **No fee mentioned anywhere in UI**

### **Behind the Scenes (Fixed):**
```
User pays 0.001 ETH
    ↓
Platform fee: 0.00005 ETH (5% of 0.001) → Silent transfer to PACO wallet
Contract gets: 0.00095 ETH (95% of 0.001) → Goes to NFT contract
```

### **Revenue Breakdown:**
- **Platform Revenue:** 0.00005 ETH per mint (5%)
- **Contract Revenue:** 0.00095 ETH per mint (95%)
- **Future Royalties:** 7.5% of secondary sales (adjustable via admin)

---

## 🎛️ **New Admin Controls**

### **Royalty Management Panel:**
- ✅ **View current royalty receiver** and percentage
- ✅ **Update royalty receiver** address
- ✅ **Adjust royalty percentage** (0-10% max)
- ✅ **Real-time updates** via smart contract calls

### **Admin Functions Added:**
```javascript
loadRoyaltyInfo()     // Load current royalty settings
updateRoyaltyInfo()   // Update royalty receiver & percentage
```

---

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### **1. Frontend (script.js):**
```javascript
// OLD (Wrong):
const mintTx = await nftContract.mint(userAddress, tokenURI, { value: mintPrice });

// NEW (Correct):
const contractPayment = mintPrice.sub(silentFeeAmount); // 95% of mint price
const mintTx = await nftContract.mint(userAddress, tokenURI, { value: contractPayment });
```

### **2. Contract Deployment:**
```javascript
// Contract expects 95% of user payment
const INITIAL_MINT_PRICE = "0.00095"; // 95% of 0.001 ETH
```

### **3. Admin Panel (admin.html):**
- Added royalty management section
- Added `loadRoyaltyInfo()` and `updateRoyaltyInfo()` functions
- Added royalty status display
